    "## Intro to Python\n",
    "Python is general Purpose, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language. It more oriented towards web dev. Python can be used in scripts or in a CLI (the interactive part of Python). In can be integrated with C++ and Java (as well as others), has automatic garbage collection and supports functional and structured programming methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invoking the Interpreter (Interactive Programming)\n",
    "The Interpreter can invoked by typing `py` into the CLI. This only works if the Python executable is installed. If Python was obtained through the windows store, the Interpreter can be invoked via the command `Python3.10`. Once the Interpreter is invoked, python \"commands\" can be entered. Below is an example of what invoking and entering \"commands\" into the interpreter looks like: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "- Used to Identify a variable, function, class, module or other object\n",
    "- Starts with A TO Z, a to z or _ followed by more letters, underscores\n",
    "- Characters such as @, $, and % are not allowed within Identifiers\n",
    "- Python is case sensitive\n",

    "- Mostly the same as other languages\n",

    "### Lines and Indentation\n",
    "- Python does not use { } for code blocks\n",
    "- Code blocks are denoted with Indentation\n",
    "- Number of spaces in indentation is variable, but code within the block must be indented the same amount\n",
