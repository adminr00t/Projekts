# Mini-project: Requirements

## Goals
- Produce a interesting proof of concept
    - Demonstrate in Video
- Learn interesting tech related to this unit
    - Demonstrate in Report

## Project: Internet of Things
- Goal: Logging internal and external temperature to ADAIO, activating a LED when the temp difference reaches a certain threshold
- Reasoning: This system when adapted to larger compute infrastructure can be used to activate cooling systems or test hardware in certain climate conditions

### Procedure
- Log internal temp to a graph on ADAIO
- Log external Temp to a graph on ADAIO
- Plot both on a single graph
- Calculate the difference
- Activate a LED once the difference threshold is reached

### Resources
- Adafruit IO
    - [Link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-temperature-and-humidity)
    - look at how basic example temp_humidity.py works
    - modify to suit required data
- [Internal temp sensor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/temperature-log)
- [External temp sensor](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-measure-humidity-temperature-dht11-dht22/)


### Use cases
- Data centers, monitoring cooling 
- Custom cooling set-ups
- thermal interface material efficiency testing 
- Hardware testing 
    - extreme climates
