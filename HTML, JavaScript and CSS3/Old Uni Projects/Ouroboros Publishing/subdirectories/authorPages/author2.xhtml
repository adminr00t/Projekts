    <h3>Biography</h3>

        <p>Born on November 12th, 1964, Nylund was first hired by Microsoft to re-write and edit their Multi-media

          developed. With the book delayed, it gave Nylund a chance to see the games development at every stage, and in
          partnership with Bungie, the original developers, wrote a book giving Master Chief and the Halo universe a
          definitive background.</p>
