Strings

Two types of string representations
    1. C-style character string
    2. String class type

C-Style Character String
    Is a one-dimensional array of characters, terminated by a null character '\0'. 
    for declaration and initalization, see Strings.cpp

Null-terminated String Manipulation Functions
    1. strcpy(s1, s2) -> copies string 2 into string 1
    2. strcat(s1, s2) -> links string 2 to the end of string 1
    3. strlen(s1) -> returns the length of string 1
    4. strcmp(s1, s2) -> compares strings, returns 0 if string 1 and 2 are the same, less than 0 if s1<s2, greater than 0 if s1>s2
    5. strchr(s1, ch) -> returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string 1
    6. strstr(s1, s2) -> returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string 2 in string 1

The String Class
    <string> supports all the operation mentioned above with much more functionality. See Strings.cpp for examples
