Storage Classes
    Defines the visibility and life-time of varaibles and/or functions within a program
    They precede the type that they modify

    Classes:
        auto - the default storage class, can only be used within functions
        register - used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM
        static - instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program
        extern - used to give a reference of a global variabale that is visible to ALL program files
        mutable - applies to only class objects. A mutable member can be modified by a const member function
