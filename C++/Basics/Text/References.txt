References
    A reference variable is an alias, another name for an existing variable. Once initialized with a variable, the var name or reference name can be called

    References vs Pointers
        Often confused with pointers. Three major differences:
            1. Cannot have NULL references -> must always be able to assume a reference is connected to a legit piece of storage
            2. Once initialized, it cannot be changed to refer to another object
            3. Must be initialized when created
    
    Creating References
        Think of a variable name as a label attached to the variables location in memory. A reference is a second label attached to that memory location.
        You can access the contents through either the original name or the reference
            int i = 17; can also be declared as int& r = i;
        See References.cpp for example
    
    Uses
        Usually used for function argument lists and return values
        Two important subjects:
            1. References as Parameters -> passing references as function Parameters more safely than Parameters
            2. References as return value -> return a reference from a function like any other data type
