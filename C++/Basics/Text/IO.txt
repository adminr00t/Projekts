Input/Output
    IO occurs in streams, sequences of bytes. If bytes flow from a device to main memory, its called a input operation. if bytes flow the other way, its an output operation

    IO Library Header Files
        IO headers that are important:
            1. <iostream> -> defines cin (standard input), cout (standard output), cerr (unbuffered standered error stream) and clog (buffered standard error stream) objects
            2. <iomanip> -> Declares services useful for performing formatted IO with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such as setw and setprecision
            3. <fstream> -> Declares services for user-controlled file processing

    Standard Output Stream (cout)
        cout is an instance of ostream. Said be connected to the standard output device, which is the display screen.
        Used in conjunction with stream inserton operatior, <<.

    Standard Input Stream (cin)
        cin is an instance of the istream class. cin is said to be attached to the standard input device, usually the keyboard
        Used in conjunction with the stream extraction operatior, >>.

    Standard Error Stream (cerr)
        cerr is an instnace of ostream class. Said to be attached to the standard error device, the display screen, but cerr is un-buffered and each stream insertion to cerr
        causes its output to appear immediately. Used in conjunction with the stream insertion operator, <<.

    Standard Log Stream (clog)
        clog is an instance of the ostream class. Said to be attached to the standard error device, which is the display screen, but clog is buffered, meaning each insertion
        to clog could cause its output to be held in a buffer until the buffer is filled or flushed
