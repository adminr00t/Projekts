Arrays
    Stores a fixed-sized sequential collection of elements of the same type.
    Instead of declaring individual variables, you declare one array variable.
    A specific elements of in an array is accessed by a index

Declaring Arrays
    Single Dimension Array:
        type arrayName [arraySize];
    where arraySize must be a integer constant greater than 0 and type can be any data type

Initializing Arrays & Accessing Elements 
    See Arrays.cpp for example

Arrays in C++
    few important concepts:
        1. Multi-dimentsional Arrays - simplest form is a 2D array
        2. Pointers to an array - can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by specifying the array name without an index
        3. Passing arrays to functions - can pass a pointer to an array to a function
        4. Return array from functions - allows a function to return an array
