Varibale Declarations
    Provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with the given type and name
    See VariableDelaration.cpp
    The same is followed when using functions

Lvalues and Rvalues
    Lvalue - Expressions that refer to a memory location. appears on either left or right side of an assignment. Variables are Lvalues
    Rvalue - a data value that is stored at some address in memory. cannot have a value assigned to it, meaning it may appear on the 
             right but not left side of an assignment. Numeric Literals are RValues\
    
Local Variables
    Variables that are declared inside a function or block. Can only be used by statements within the Blocks

Global Variables
    Defined outside of all functions, usually at the top of the program. Holds their value throughout the life-time of the program.
    Can be accessed by any function. The same name can be used for a locale and global variable, but the value of the local variable will take prefference
