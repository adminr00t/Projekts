Maths
    working with data usually means working with primitive data types (int, short, float and double).

Defining Numbers
    See Math.cpp for example

Mathematical Operations
    Need to include the header <cmath>
    Types:
        double cos(double) -> takes an angle and returns the cosine
        double sin(double) -> takes an angle and returns the sine
        double tan(double) -> takes an angle and returns the tangent
        double log(double) -> takes a number and returns the natural log
        double pow(double, double) -> first is the number to raise, second is the power you wish to raise it to
        double hypot(double double) -> takes the legnth of two sides and returns the legnth of the hypotenuse
        double swrt(double) -> square root of a number
        int abs(int) -> returns the absolute value of a interger
        double fabs(double) returns the absolute value of a decimal number
        double floor(double) -> finds the int that is less than or equal to the argument passed

Random Numbers
    Two ways to generate random numbers:
        1. rand() -> only returns a pseudo-random number, this creates the same random numbers every time it is run
        2. srand() -> sets the seed of the pseudo-random number generator
    Can set seed based on time
