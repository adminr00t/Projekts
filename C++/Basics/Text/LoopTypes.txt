Loop Types
    Allows for execution of a statement or group of statements multiple times
    Types:
        1. While - while a condition is true, repeat
        2. For - for x amount of times, repeat
        3. Do... While - while loop but tests condition at the end of loop
        4. Nested loops - loops within loops, loop-ception

Loop Control Statements
    Statements that change the loop execution
    Types:
        1. Break - breaks/terminates the loop cycle
        2. Continue - skips the remainder and retest the condition
        3. Goto - transfers control to the labeled statement

Infinite Loop
    Occurs when a condition never becomes false.
    See infiniteLoop.cpp
