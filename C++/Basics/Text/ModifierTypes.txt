Modifier Types
    Allows char, int and double data types to have modifiers preceding them. Used to alter the meaning of the base type to more precisely fit the need of various situations

    Modifiers:
        Signed - can be applied to integer base types and char or as a prefix to long/short
        Unsigned - can be applied to integer base types and char or as a prefix to long/short
        Long - can be applied to integer base types and double
        Short - can be applied to integer base types
    
    Short Hand Notation
        Allows short hand notation, can drop the integer type:
            unsigned x; instead of unsigned int x;

    Type Qualifiers
        1. const - cannot be changed by program during execution
        2. volatile - tells the compiler that a variables value may change in ways not explicitly specified by the program
        3. restrict - initially the only means by which the object it points to can be accessed
